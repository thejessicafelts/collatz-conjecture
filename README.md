# **Collatz Conjecture**

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that is named after **Lothar Collatz**, who first introduced the idea in 1937. It concerns sequences of numbers, defined as follows: 

- Start with any positive integer: `n`. 

Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 

- If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term: `(n / 2)`.

- If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1: `((n * 3) + 1)`.

The conjecture is that no matter what value of `n`, the sequence will always reach 1.

## **About Me**

I am a Senior/Lead Software Engineer and an Accessibility Advocate. I am currently completing dual Bachelor of Science degrees -- one in Neuroscience, and the other in CMB (Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, and Biomedical Sciences). I have a passion for Neuroscience, and am translating that into a career change to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
